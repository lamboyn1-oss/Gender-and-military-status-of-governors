# Gender-and-military-status-of-governors

The gender of governors who served in the military matters because we can look at the number of men compared to women who are in the military. 

The data was collected by finding and coding different variables that deal with different governors throughout the states. The two selected variables were gender and military status for governors. Gender was coded by 0- men and 1- women. And military was coded by 0- no and 1- yes. 
The data was operationalized by finding out different variables about each governor throughout a certain time period and then coding those variables.
